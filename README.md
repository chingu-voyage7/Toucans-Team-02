# Goal

Create a responsive and functionally complete copy of the product 
landing page.

You can see the original landing page [here] 
(http://quomodosoft.com/html/lunatic/lunatic/index.html).

- We'll attempt to copy the design and function of the page to the best of 
our abilities.

- If there's some function we can't copy, we'll leave a placeholder.

- Also, we can add to or modify the design if we feel we can do better.


# Vision


Work together, support one another, and learn from one another to finish 
our project.
